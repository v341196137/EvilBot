# EvilBot
The results of playing around with the Discord.py library for a bit of time. A lot of commented out code probably only exists for reference because looking through the API is tiring.  
Looking back, I guess this repo is a nice summary of my improvement over time. No `.gitignore`, no clue what closures were but using them in a discord bot anyways, large chunks of really bad and messy code.... you get the point. I'm going to just leave this repo the way it is, partly because it's cool to look back but mostly because I'm too lazy to refactor this. Peace :P
