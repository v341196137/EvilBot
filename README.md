# EvilBot
The results of playing around with the Discord.py library for a bit of time. A lot of commented out code probably only exists for reference because looking through the API is tiring. 
## Functions
* Moderation bot
  * Kick
  * Ban
  * Unban
* Host games
  * Hangman
  * "Math"
## TODO
- [ ] Organize to have a moderation cog instead of jamming everything there
- [ ] Make tic tac toe playable
- [ ] Make connect 4 playable
- [ ] Make hangman's initiator not able to guess
- [ ] Learn how to make Evil Bot connect to voice channels to speak of world domination/play music
- [X] Learn how to use embeds
- [ ] ~~Make math game have 10 rounds or something like that~~
